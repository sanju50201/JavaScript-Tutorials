// var, let and const are used to declare variables 
let a = 52;
console.log(a)
// variables can be changed in the runtime, hence hello will also be printed
a = 'Hello'
console.log(a) 
// throws error in following cases
// let 8sanju = 25; variable starts with number  
// let var = 7 cannnot be used, since it is a JS keyword
